## How to use

You must install the XAMPP software to create a local server so that you can run PHP and SQL files. Launch XAMPP and start Apache and MySQL.

### Apache server

Click on Explorer and go to the htdocs folder to clone this repository.

### MySQL and databases

Click on MySQL Admin to open phpMyAdmin, then create two databases with the same names (`dbs12515927` and `dbs12522068`).
Finally, go to each database and click on **Import** at the top to add the two SQL files located in the database folder.
